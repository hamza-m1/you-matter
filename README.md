** Typography **

I used chewy from google fonts for headers and titles because it's playful, calming and bold.
I used Quicksand from google fonts because its easy to read and complements Chewy.

** colour Scheme **

- #025951; Dark green
- #a9d8ae; Medium green
- #fffdec; Light yellow

I decided to go with a leafy green colour scheme as it reflects nature, which is calming so would help the user feel calm and relaxed as they navigate through the site.
